# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights. It covers data loading and cleaning in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based analysis on relational databases, and interactive visualization through Power BI. The final insights are documented in a report and presented via a professional slide deck.

**Goal:** Convert messy data into clear, actionable insights using industry-standard tools.

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** Provided CSV dataset (can be replaced with any structured dataset)
* **Size:** Medium-scale, suitable for EDA and SQL querying
* **Data Types:** Numerical, categorical, and date/time fields
* **Use Case:** Business analysis (sales / customer / operations metrics)


---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, cleaning, EDA

  * Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **SQL:** Data querying and aggregation

  * Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and KPIs
* **Gamma:** PPT generation for executive presentation
* **Excel (optional):** Quick validation and cross-checks

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import dataset into Python using pandas
   * Basic schema and data-type validation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics
   * Distribution analysis
   * Missing value and outlier detection
   * Key trends and patterns

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing and inconsistent values
   * Standardize column formats
   * Remove duplicates and invalid records

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Load cleaned data into relational database
   * Write optimized SQL queries:

     * Filters and aggregations
     * Joins and subqueries
     * Business-focused metrics

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Build Power BI dashboard
   * Create KPIs, charts, and slicers
   * Enable drill-down and interactivity

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Document insights in a structured report
   * Create a concise PPT using Gamma for stakeholders

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis over time
* Category-wise and segment-wise breakdowns
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis


---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key drivers impacting performance
* Highlighted trends and anomalies in the data
* Provided actionable recommendations based on analysis
* Enabled data-driven decision-making through visualization

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python notebooks/scripts for EDA and cleaning
4. Load the cleaned data into your SQL database
5. Execute SQL queries from the `/sql` folder
6. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore the dashboard
7. Review the report and presentation for final insights
